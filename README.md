### Hi friend! 👋

I'm a first year CS student at the University of Waterloo! I've been exploring every part of CS that I can—from making a ~1400 elo chess AI ♟♙ to my very own website for learning guitarists 🎸. As you probably could've guessed, I'm a huge fan of chess and the guitar, but I also enjoy reading, working out, and playing basketball.

Feel free to reach out to me at sam.liu512@gmail.com 😉!
