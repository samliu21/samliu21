### Hi friend! 👋

I'm a second year CS student at the University of Waterloo! I've been exploring every part of CS I can—from making a ~1200 elo <a href="https://github.com/samliu21/chess-ai">chess AI</a> ♟♙ to a <a href="https://github.com/samliu21/lyrics-chords">website</a> for learning guitarists 🎸. As you probably could've guessed, I'm a huge fan of chess and the guitar, but I also enjoy reading, running, working out, and playing basketball.

Feel free to reach out to me at sam.liu512@gmail.com, even if you just want a chess game 😉! Have a look at my resume <a href="https://github.com/samliu22/storage/blob/master/Resume%20-%20Sam%20Liu.pdf">here</a>!
